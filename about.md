My background is a little bit unusual and I often don't know how to answer the
simple question "What do you do?"

The long answer is that I studied music composition in Brazil and at the
University of Texas at Austin and I was a [visiting
professor](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~kroger/) at the Stanford University.
Although my doctorate was in composition, my dissertation was on computer music
where I developed a language for sound synthesis. I have been programming since
the early 90s and I've worked with languages such as Pascal, Tcl, Common Lisp,
Scheme, and Python.

I love long term travel and lived and visited different places in the USA, South America,
Europe, and Asia.

Recently, I became interested in bootstrapping a business so Iâ€™m working on some
products, like a [book to teach music to programmers](/mfgan/), <del>a few iOS apps</del>
(update: it didn't work out), and a [book about PyCharm](/pycharm-book/).

So when people ask what I do I never know if I should say composer, professor,
programmer, traveler, or bootstrapper. ðŸ™‚
