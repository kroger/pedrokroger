In July 2012 I published my ebook, [Music For Geeks and Nerds][1]. I earned about $6,000
in profit in the first seven days and more than $10,000 in one year. It‚Äôs not nearly as
much as some people are doing, but it‚Äôs reportedly [more than what I could make with
traditional publishing][3]. It‚Äôs my first profitable product and I‚Äôve learned a lot from
publishing it. I hope this post will be a useful datapoint to anyone interested in
self-publishing their own book.

## Validating the Idea

I had the idea of a book to use programming to teach music for a long time. To see if
people were interested I presented the tutorial [Making and understanding music with
Python and a little bit of Math][4] at a Python conference. I had no idea if people were
going to subscribe to the tutorial, but in the end I had a great time teaching it and
since I received good feedback I decided to go ahead and write the book. Validation is an
important step because nobody likes to work on something for hundred hours only to
discover that nobody wants it.

## Payment Processing

I sell the book on my [own website][1] and on [Amazon][5] (both Kindle and paper). On my
site I use e-junkie (with PayPal) and Gumroad for payment processing. At the time I
didn‚Äôt know what to expect, so I went with both. Today I would use Gumroad only. [This
article][6] by Sacha Greif comparing payment processors was very useful.¬†To this day I
get most of my sales from PayPal, but I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs because the big button links
to the e-junkie cart:

I‚Äôve been meaning to ditch PayPal and use only Gumroad, but I never got around it.
  
The percentage of sales in the first week were: 75% from e-junkie, 15% from Gumroad, and
10% from Amazon. Today it‚Äôs almost 50‚Äì50 between e-junkie and Amazon.

## Learning About Marketing

As an academic my knowledge about marketing and launching products was negative. I
learned a lot from Rob Walling‚Äôs [Start Small, Stay Small][8] and from the 
[Micropreneur academy][9] (run by Rob and Mike Taber). The Academy has a private forum
were we can ask questions and help each other. Before launching I received very good
suggestions from many people, specially from Dave Rodenbaugh (thanks Dave!).

## Launch Day

I was so afraid that PayPal would freeze my account that I called to let them know that I
was going to sell a book and that I might have a few sales.
  
I sent an email to my mailing list and posted a link to Hacker News, where I did managed
to get on the first page:

I also managed to be the 3rd book on the Music category on Amazon and 5th on Programming:

I was overwhelmed by the [positive response][12]. Some have even emailed me to say they
liked the silly jokes in the book! üòâ
  
It was a really good idea to clear my schedule and stay home answering questions and suggestions on Hacker News, email, and twitter, and fixing small problems.

## Lessons Learned

These are the main lessons I learned:

  1. Have packages and different tiers. I did think about having screencasts and videos but I just didn‚Äôt have the energy nor the time. Not only it could have increased my revenue but it could have increased the value for the readers.
  2. Have a mailing list and keep it updated. I had a mailing list, but I only wrote once to announce the book launch. As a consequence the conversion rate from the mailing list was small.
  3. Write blog posts. I could have written some blog posts on my website and as a guest on other blogs to raise interest in the book.
  4. My Amazon sales probably cannibalized some of the sales on my website. Having a book on Amazon may be good for validation (‚ÄúLook ma, my book is on Amazon!‚Äù) and it‚Äôs also good for the readers since they have another way to purchase the book. But I probably won‚Äôt use Amazon for my next book.

In all, I‚Äôm happy with my first book. It‚Äôs hardly a full income, but I had a blast by actually launching something (instead of day dreaming) and learning more about non-academic publishing. I‚Äôm happy that I could produce something that hundreds of people found useful and I‚Äôm looking forward to launch my next book.
