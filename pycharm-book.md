title: Modern Python Development with PyCharm
layout: page
---

PyCharm is one of the most popular and featureful IDEs for Python. It has thousands of
features that can make you very productive, but it takes time to learn.

You could read PyCharm's massive on-line help and search the Internet to gather the
information you need, but <mark>I have already done the work for you!</mark>

Modern Python Development with PyCharm covers all the relevant things you need <mark>without unnecessary meandering.</mark>

## Get It For Free!

I used to sell the book, but I've decided to make it available for free since it's not
updated to newer PyCharm versions. This book uses PyCharm 4.0.4 Professional Edition.
PyCharm has changed over the last years, but the principles are the same, so the book may
still be useful to you.

## Learn How To Be Productive With Pycharm

Maybe you tried to use PyCharm but couldn't make it stick, couldn't wrap your head around
it, or just went back to your favorite editor.

PyCharm is not perfect and may not replace a powerful editor completely. However, it is
packed with great features such as unsurpassed code completion and inspection, an
advanced debugger, and unified support for web programming, including frameworks such as
Django and Flask. PyCharm has many <mark>features that will make you more
productive.</mark>
