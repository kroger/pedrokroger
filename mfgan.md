title: Music for Geeks and Nerds
layout: page
---

In this book you'll learn some elements of music from a programmer's perspective. You'll
see:

- primitives of music such as notes and duration
- means of combining primitives into motives and chords
- music operations such as transposition, retrograde, and inversion
- means of abstraction phrases and form

Are you interested in learning more about music but have found most material
condescending or to present things magically instead of logically? The good news is that
much of music can be understood with programming and math, two things you're already good
at!
